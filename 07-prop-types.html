                When you start creating custom function components, you are gonna have people using those function components,
                and they may not use them quite right, for example here we have the SayHello component that accepts firstName,
                and lastName props, and expecting to be able render those out, but the way it is being used, we pass firstName as false
                , but we are not providing the lastName at all, and the end result is not exactly what we are looking for, the React team
                has developed a package called PropTypes, that allows us to add runtime validation of the props that are passed to your components.
                In this case we are going to build the validations ourselves.

                One more thing, I was not able to make SayHello.propTypes work at the beginning, then I found out it was because
                I was using the production version of react, I replaced it with development.
